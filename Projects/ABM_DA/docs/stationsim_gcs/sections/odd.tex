\section{ODD Protocol}
\label{sec:odd}

ODD (Overview, Design Concepts, Details) is a protocol for outlining and
documenting agent-based models
\cite{grimm2006standard,grimm2010odd,grimm2020odd}.
The aim of such a protocol is to allow researchers to share and reproduce their
models via a standardised format.
The protocol consists of three components, each of which cover a number of
different topics:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Overview providing an overview of the model, touching upon each of the
        following topics outlined in Section \ref{sub:odd:overview}.
    \item Design Concepts: detailing which of the following design concepts are
        relevant to the model (detailed in Section
        \ref{sub:odd:design_concepts}).
    \item Details: elaborating on the internal mechanics of the model, which
        will cover each of the topics outlined in Section \ref{sub:odd:details}.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Overview}
\label{sub:odd:overview}

The Overview section of ODD aims to provide a cursory overview of the model that
is being documented.
This includes subsections on each of the following topics:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Purpose and patterns
    \item Entities, state variables and scales
    \item Process overview and scheduling
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Design Concepts}
\label{sub:odd:design_concepts}

When designing an agent-based model, there are a number of design concepts that
are often incorporated.
The following is a non-exhaustive list of the design concepts that may be
involved in an agent-based model:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Basic principles
    \item Emergence
    \item Adaptation
    \item Objectives
    \item Learning
    \item Prediction
    \item Sensing
    \item Interaction
    \item Stochasticity
    \item Collectives
    \item Observation
\end{enumerate}
These design concepts are detailed in greater depth in \cite{grimm2010odd}.

\subsection{Details}
\label{sub:odd:details}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Initialisation
    \item Input data
    \item Submodels
\end{enumerate}
